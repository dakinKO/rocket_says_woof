***IMPORTANT***: Change SCREEN_HEIGHT and SCREEN_WIDTH values to fit the size of your screen

This has been my process this far:      
Set up a grid to position everything.  
Finished a simple pathfinding algorithm and added walls to create the path.  
Created an Enemy class and added a move method to move along the path.  
Created Levels class to incorporate planned waves of enemies.  
Created a Messages class for easy text rendering and blitting.  
Created a User Info class to hold info such as lives, level, wave, ...  
Created a GG screen for when you run out of lives.
