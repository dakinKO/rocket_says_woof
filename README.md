For reagan from rocket

This has been my process this far:      
Set up a grid to position everything. 
Finished a simple pathfinding algorithm and added walls to create the path. 
Created an Enemy class and added a move method to move along the path. 
Created Levels class to incorporate planned waves of enemies. 
Created a Messages class for easy text rendering and blitting. 
Created a User Info class to hold info such as lives, level, wave, ...  
Created a GG screen for when you run out of lives.
